## Overview

::: incremental
- We propose a flexible Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for modeling claim frequency and severity, and for many other applications

- We showcase a few case studies to demonstrate the theoretical flexibility and wide applicability of the framework

- Our model has been implemented in Julia and R as open-source packages, readily available for a variety of applications

- Joint work by the [actuarial research group](https://actsci.utstat.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto: Tsz Chai (Samson) Fung, Spark Tseung, Prof. Andrei Badescu, and Prof. X. Sheldon Lin

# Motivating Examples

## Actuaries: GLM is great!

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
::: incremental
- GLM is simple yet powerful.

- GLM is easy to implement.

- GLM is interpretable and accessible.

- **However, GLM can fail miserably in insurance applications, because real data do not satisfy GLM assumptions.**

## GLM fails when...

::: nonincremental
- Claim frequency distribution is heavy-tailed.

- There is an excess probability of zero claims.
::: 

. . .

Example: Australian auto insurance data (*ausprivauto040*) in *CASDatasets* [@dutang2020package],
analyzed in [@badescu2021actuaryarticle].

## GLM fails when...

::: nonincremental
- Claim severity distribution is multimodal and/or heavy-tailed.

- Observations are censored and/or truncated.
:::

. . .

::: {.column width="40%"}
Example: French auto insurance data (*freMTPLsev*) in *CASDatasets* [@dutang2020package],
analyzed in [@tseung2021lrmoe].

## Insurance data are heterogeneous.

::: nonincremental
- Policyholders' risk profiles are different, even within the same portfolio.
- One way to capture such heterogeneity is to use a **mixture** model.
:::

. . .

Example: Modelling claim frequency with a 3-component Poisson mixture.

---

## Covariates are important.

::: nonincremental
- Policyholders' information, or covariates, are predictive of their risk profile.
- We may use **regression** to classify policyholders into different risk groups, and model each group separately.
:::

. . .

Example: A Poisson mixture model combined with logistic regression.

---

## MoE = Regression + Mixture

This is an example of our proposed Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework.

::: incremental
- We first classify policyholders into different latent risk groups with a multiple logistic regression.
- Within each risk group, we model the response (frequency or severity) with an appropriate distribution (or expert).
:::

## MoE: Flexibile and Powerful

::: nonincremental
- The MoE framework is extremely flexible and powerful (more details later).
- For example, it offers a much better fit to data compared with GLM.
:::

. . .

Example: Australian auto insurance data (*ausprivauto040*) in *CASDatasets* [@dutang2020package],
analyzed in [@badescu2021actuaryarticle].
