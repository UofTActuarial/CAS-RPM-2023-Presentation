## Overview

::: incremental
- We propose a flexible Mixture-of-Experts framework for modeling claim frequency and severity, and for many other applications

- We showcase a few case studies to demonstrate the theoretical flexibility and wide applicability of the framework

- Our model has been implemented in Julia and R as open-source packages, readily available for a variety of applications

- Joint work by the [actuarial research group](https://actsci.utstat.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto: Tsz Chai (Samson) Fung, Spark Tseung, Prof. Andrei Badescu, and Prof. X. Sheldon Lin

## Actuaries: GLM is great!

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
::: incremental
- GLM is simple yet powerful.

- GLM is easy to implement.

- GLM is interpretable and accessible.

- **However, GLM can fail miserably in insurance applications, because real data do not satisfy GLM assumptions.**

## GLM fails when...


::: nonincremental
- Claim frequency distribution is heavy-tailed.

- There is an excess probability of zero claims.

. . .

Example: Australian auto insurance data (*ausprivauto040*) in CASDatasets

## GLM fails when...

::: nonincremental
- Claim severity distribution is multimodal and/or heavy-tailed.

- Observations are censored and/or truncated.
